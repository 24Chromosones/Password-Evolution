# Password evolution algorithm
An evolution algorithm to find an ASCII password. CURRENTLY UNFINISHED 

## Process
After the first creation of the population. The fitness of every unit
is checked and the bottom 50% of units die. Then the remaining units reproduce
and create a new unit with a random letters of the password shared by the parents.
Then new random units are added to fill up the population to the max. There is
also a mutation function that has a 1% change to happen to every unit where 1 character
in the password gets mutated.

TLDR: creation > bottom 50% die > reproduction > mutation > introducing random units

## Setup
To be finished
